# Untitled
Yes, we really called this one "Untitled". This is a little project done for a relational database class I attended at UBC in the Fall of 2018.

The basic idea behind this "website" was to create, manipulate and display a sample database of TV shows for "users" to review, similar to existing services such as Rotten Tomatoes. Considering the fact that this project merely serves as an exercise for SQL and PHP skills, its overall purpose is quite trivial. However, it greatly inspired me for upcoming projects in the works.
